/**
 * A Consistent Hashing implementation class which can work with existing node
 * types representing nodes to which requests are handed.
 * <p>
 * This class is by design not thread-safe for node mutations
 * (Additions/removals) Such mutations should be handled externally and a new
 * instance of this class should be created with the new node list. This allows
 * for lock free implementation in this class keeping the code performant. (For
 * instance, in the caller application there can be a thread to poll discovery
 * every so often to get an updated node list and if there are differences
 * between the previously held list and the new one, a new instance of
 * {@link ConsistentHash} can be created and the old one can be swapped with the
 * new one. Also the calling application can decide how nodes map to keys used
 * for hashing through the {@link NodeConfiguration} implementation - for
 * instance they can ensure that new nodes take the same "slot" as an old one it
 * is replacing by keeping track of global slots.)
 * <p>
 * Callers should verify that the node returned by
 * {@link ConsistentHash#get(byte[])} is alive before using it to retrieve the
 * value.
 * <p>
 * Copied mostly from http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2007/11/27/consistent-hashing
 * Also inspired by KetamaNodeLocator in spy memcached code
